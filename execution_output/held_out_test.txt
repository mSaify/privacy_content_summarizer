['The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (“we” or “us”), is a+nonprofit charitable organization whose mission is to empower and engage+people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or+in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally, free of+charge.', 'To support our vibrant community, we provide the essential infrastructure and+organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki Projects and+their editions (as explained here) and other endeavors which serve this+mission.', 'We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from+the Projects available on the internet free of charge, in perpetuity.', 'We welcome you (“you” or the “user”) as a reader, editor, author, or+contributor of the Wikimedia Projects, and we encourage you to join the+Wikimedia community.', 'Before you participate, however, we ask that you please+read and agree to the following Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”).', 'We want you to know that we host an+incredible quantity of educational and informational content, all of which is+contributed and made possible by users like yourself.', 'Generally we do not+contribute, monitor, or delete content (with the rare exception of policies+like these Terms of Use or legal compliance for DMCA notices).', 'This means that+editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and+manage the content.', 'The community – the network of users who are constantly building and using the+various sites or Projects – are the principal means through which the goals of+the mission are achieved.', 'The community undertakes the critical function of creating and+enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different+language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multi-+lingual edition).', 'You are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you should+follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions.', 'The+largest of our Projects is Wikipedia, but we host other Projects too, each+with different objectives and work methods.', 'Each Project edition has a team of+contributors, editors or authors who work together to create and manage the+content on that Project edition.', 'You are welcome to join these teams and work+with them to improve these Projects.', 'Because we are dedicated to making+content freely accessible to the public, we generally require that all content+you contribute is available under a free license or in the public domain.', 'Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your+contributions, edits, and re-use of Wikimedia content under the laws of the+United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include the laws+where you live or where you view or edit content).', 'This means it is important+that you use caution when posting content.', 'In light of this responsibility, we+have some rules about what you cannot post, most of which is either for your+own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself.', 'Please keep+in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only,+so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical,+legal, or financial issues), you should seek the help of a licensed or+qualified professional.', 'We also include other important notices and+disclaimers, so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety.', 'For clarity, other organizations, such as local Wikimedia chapters and+associations, that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally+independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation and have no+responsibility for the operations of the website or its content.', 'Modifications to these Terms of Use+  * 19 17\\.', 'Our Services++The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development+and distribution of free multilingual content, and to hosting the full content+of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge.', 'Our role is to+host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the+world, which can be found here.', 'However, we act only as a hosting service,+maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework that allows our+users to build the Wikimedia Projects by contributing and editing content+themselves.', 'Because of our unique role, there are a couple of things you+should be aware of when considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and+the other users:++  1.', 'This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content.', 'Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services, and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content.', 'Instead, we simply provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed and edited.', 'For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America.', 'Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content.', 'WMF generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.', 'Privacy Policy++We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy, so that you are aware+of how we collect and use your information.', 'Because our services are used by+people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored+and processed in the United States of America or any other country in which we+or our agents maintain facilities.', 'By using our services, you consent to any+such transfer of information outside your country.', 'We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.', 'Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project websites.', 'Refraining from Certain Activities++The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the+vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate+the content.', 'We+encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the+community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions aimed at+furthering the mission of the shared Project.', 'Certain activities, whether legal or illegal, may be harmful to other users+and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to liability.', 'Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users, you may not+engage in such activities on our sites.', 'As part of these obligations, you must disclose your employer, client, and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive, or expect to receive, compensation.', 'You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways:++    ++    ++  * a statement on your user page,+  * a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions, or+  * a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions.', 'Applicable law, or community and Foundation policies and guidelines, such as those addressing conflicts of interest, may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure.', 'A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy.', 'If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy, you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section when contributing to that Project.', 'An alternative paid contribution policy will only supersede these requirements if it is approved by the relevant Project community and listed in the alternative disclosure policy page.', 'For more information, please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions.', 'We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to+the above terms.', 'Password Security++You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and should never+disclose it to any third party.', 'Trademarks++Although you have considerable freedoms for re-use of the content on the+Project websites, it is important that, at the Wikimedia Foundation, we+protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent+impersonators.', 'Because of this, we ask that you please respect our trademarks.', 'All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation, and+any use of our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, or domain names+must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our+Trademark Policy.', 'Licensing of Content++To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing+to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to the general public+to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely, so long as that use is+properly attributed and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is+granted to any derivative works.', 'In keeping with our goal of providing free+information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary+all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who+cares to access it.', 'You agree to the following licensing requirements:++  1.', '(Re-users may comply with either license or both.)', 'The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different+license.', 'In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that+particular license.', 'For example, at the publication of this version of the+Terms of Use, English Wikinews mandates that all text content is licensed+under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic License (CC BY 2.5) and+does not require a dual license with GFDL.', 'Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your+contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms.', 'We consider it giving credit where credit is due – to authors like yourself.', 'When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions: +    1.', 'Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all authors and editors);+    2.', 'Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or+    3.', 'Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).', 'You agree that, if you import text under a CC BY-SA license that requires+attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion.', 'Where such+credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal+copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is+recorded in the page history, when importing the text.', 'The attribution+requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances+(regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia+community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.', 'When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing.', 'Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to that Project.', 'It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition.', 'When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.', 'Any re-use must comply with the underlying license(s).', 'When you re-use or re-distribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia+community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following+fashions:++    1.', 'Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are re-using (since each page has a history page that lists all authors and editors);+    2.', 'Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or+    3.', 'Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).', 'If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the+content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as+described in “Importing text,” above).', 'In that case, you agree to comply with+the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to re-license it+under GFDL.', 'To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek+to re-use or re-distribute, you should review the page footer, page history,+and discussion page.', 'In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources+and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches+additional attribution requirements.', 'Depending on the Project, such requirements+may appear for example in a banner or other notations pointing out that some+or all of the content was originally published elsewhere.', 'Where there are such+visible notations, re-users should preserve them.', 'For any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under which+the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the+work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing+an applicable source page for that work).', 'When re-using any content that we+host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they+pertain to the underlying license or licenses.', 'When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have+obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added+content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made+available.', 'With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that+the original work has been modified.', 'If you are re-using text content in a+wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change+to the imported text.', 'For each copy or modified version that you distribute,+you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is+released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the+license or a copy of the license itself.', 'DMCA Compliance++The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be+re-used by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing+the proprietary rights of others.', 'In fairness to our users, as well as to+other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices of+alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital+Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).', 'Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in+appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network+who are repeat infringers.', 'However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good+faith.', 'In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file counter-+notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is+invalid or improper.', 'For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA+notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the Chilling Effects+website.', 'If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the+Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be removed+under the DMCA.', 'To make such a request, please email us at+`legal`!', '[@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/15px-+At_sign.svg.png)`wikimedia.org` or snail mail our designated agent at this+address.', 'Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often handles+copyright issues faster and more effectively than prescribed under the DMCA.', 'In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns.', 'For a+non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the+different Project editions, look here.', 'Before filing a DMCA claim, you also+have the option of sending an email to the community at+`info`!', '[@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/15px-+At_sign.svg.png)`wikimedia.org`.', 'Third-party Websites and Resources++You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or+resources.', 'Although the Projects contain links to third-party websites and+resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their+availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services+(including, without limitation, any viruses or other disabling features), nor+do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.', 'Management of Websites++The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying+to the different Project editions.', 'At the Wikimedia Foundation, we rarely+intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement.', 'In an+unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address an+especially problematic user because of significant Project disturbance or+dangerous behavior.', "In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not have the+obligation to:++  * Investigate your use of the service (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use, Project edition policy, or other applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;+  * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues or respond to user support requests;+  * Refuse, disable, or restrict access to the contribution of any user who violates these Terms of Use;+  * Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use, including repeat copyright infringement;+  * Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and+  * Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the public.", 'In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme circumstance+that any individual has had his or her account or access blocked under this+provision, he or she is prohibited from creating or using another account on+or seeking access to the same Project, unless we provide explicit permission.', "Without limiting the authority of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation+itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's+account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result+in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies.", 'The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed+by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project+edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or+banning users who violate those policies.', 'You agree to comply with the final+decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community+for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these+decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific+Project edition.', 'Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on+multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project+editions, in accordance with the Global Ban Policy.', 'In contrast to Board+resolutions or these Terms of Use, policies established by the community,+which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like+the Global Ban Policy), may be modified by the relevant community according to+its own procedures.', 'The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this+provision shall be in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms of Use.', 'Resolutions and Project Policies++The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from+time to time.', 'Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project+or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them as+applicable.', 'Termination++Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects, you+can stop using our services any time.', 'In certain (hopefully unlikely)+circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia+community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or all+of our services, terminate these Terms of Use, block your account or access,+or ban you as a user.', 'If your account or access is blocked or otherwise+terminated for any reason, your public contributions will remain publicly+available (subject to applicable policies), and, unless we notify you+otherwise, you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of+reading publicly available content on the Projects.', 'In such circumstances,+however, you may not be able to access your account or settings.', 'We reserve+the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause,+and with or without notice.', 'Even after your use and participation are banned,+blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with+respect to relevant provisions, including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and+17.', 'Disputes and Jurisdiction++_Highlighted for emphasis_++We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the event+there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute+resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project+editions and the Wikimedia Foundation.', 'If you seek to file a legal claim+against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal+court located in San Francisco County, California.', 'You also agree that the+laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the+United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal+claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of+laws principles).', 'You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and+agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County,+California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of+Use.', 'To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that+regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action+you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms+of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if+earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause+of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever+barred).', 'Disclaimers++_Highlighted for emphasis_++At the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and+informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is+at your sole risk.', 'We provide these services on an "as is" and "as available"+basis,

of or in any way connected with+any claim you have against any such third parties.', 'No advice or information,+whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our+services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.', 'Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services+is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible+for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the+download of any such material.', 'You agree that we have no responsibility or+liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any+content or communication maintained by the service.', 'We retain the right to+create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or+without notice.', 'Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this+section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on+the law.', 'Limitation on Liability++_Highlighted for emphasis_++The Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for+any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages,+including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use,+data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the+possibility of such damage.', 'In no event shall our liability exceed one+thousand U.S. dollars (USD 1000.00) in aggregate.', 'In the case that applicable+law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or+consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you,+although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by+applicable law.', "Modifications to these Terms of Use++Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and+maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential for+these Terms of Use to properly serve our users.", 'Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well as any+substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community for+comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period.', 'If a+future proposed revision is substantial, we will provide an additional 30 days+for comments after posting a translation of the proposed revision in at least+three languages (selected at our discretion).', 'The community will be encouraged+to translate the proposed revision in other languages as appropriate.', "For+changes for legal or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate+statement, or changes in response to community comments, we will provide at+least three (3) days' notice.", 'Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time, we+will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment via+the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L.', 'However,+we ask that you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of+these Terms of Use.', 'Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of+Use become official following the notice and review period constitutes an+acceptance of these Terms of Use on your part.', 'For the protection of the+Wikimedia Foundation and other users like yourself, if you do not agree with+our Terms of Use, you cannot use our services.', 'Other Terms++These Terms of Use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint+venture relationship between you and us, the Wikimedia Foundation.', 'If you have+not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Use are the entire+agreement between you and us.', 'If there is any conflict between these Terms of+Use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement+will control.', 'You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding+changes to the Terms of Use, by email, regular mail, or postings on Project+websites.', 'If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these+Terms of Use, it is not a waiver of that provision.', 'You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no+expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you+provide to us, the community, or the Wikimedia Projects or Project editions.', 'Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Use, we (the+Wikimedia Foundation) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms and+requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or Project+editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of Use.', 'These Terms of Use were written in English (U.S.).', 'While we hope that+translations of these Terms of Use are accurate, in the event of any+differences in meaning between the original English version and a translation,+the original English version takes precedence.', 'If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is found+unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is+deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will be enforced to the maximum+extent

with+transparency.', 'This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the+non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia,+collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of+the Wikimedia Sites.', 'It is essential to understand that, by using any of the+Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing,

lawyers) should be able to easily understand how+and why their information is collected and used, we use common language+instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy.', 'To help ensure your+understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:++  ++When we say...  | ... we mean:  +---|---  +"the Wikimedia Foundation" / "the Foundation" / "we" / "us" / "our"  | The+Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., the non-profit organization that operates the+Wikimedia Sites.', '"Wikimedia Sites" / "our services"  | Wikimedia websites and services+(regardless of language), including our main projects, such as Wikipedia and+Wikimedia Commons, as well as mobile applications, APIs, emails, and+notifications; excluding, however, sites and services listed in the "What

 | Content you add or changes you make to any Wikimedia Sites.', '"personal information"  | Information you provide us or information we collect+from you in the context of your use of the Wikimedia Sites that could be used+to personally identify you.', 'To be clear, while we do not necessarily collect+all of the following types of information, we consider at least the following+to be Personal Information if it can be used to identify you:++    (a) name, address, phone number, email address, username, password, identification number on government-issued ID, IP addresses, user-agent information, and credit card number; and;+    (b) when associated with an identifiable person, any sensitive data such as date of birth, gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origins, marital

services,+products, and applications that are not controlled, managed, or operated by+the Wikimedia Foundation.', 'This includes other Wikimedia users and independent+organizations or groups who help promote the Wikimedia movement such as+Wikimedia chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups as well as+volunteers, employees, directors, officers, grant recipients, and contractors+of those organizations or groups.', 'This Policy also applies to information that we+receive from our partners or other third parties.', 'To understand more about+what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.', 'Examples of What This Privacy Policy Covers  +  +---  +  +For the sake of clarity, this Privacy Policy covers, regardless of language:++  * All of our major sites (found at list of major projects), such as Wikipedia, including user pages, discussion pages, and noticeboards.', '* Our blogs and APIs (unless we have provided a separate policy for those services).', '* Emails, SMS, and notifications from us or sent to us from you.', 'This Privacy Policy, however, does not cover some situations where we may+gather or process information.', 'For example, some uses may be covered by+separate privacy policies (like those of the Wikimedia Shop) or sites or+services run by third parties (such as third-party developer projects on+Wikimedia Cloud Services).', 'To understand more about what this Privacy Policy+does not cover, please see below.', 'More on what this Privacy Policy doesn’t cover  +  +---  +  +This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail+which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.', 'Wikimedia Sites and Tools with alternative policies++    Some Wikimedia Foundation websites or tools have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy.', 'This separate policy will also be made available where the Extension can be downloaded.', 'If a Wikimedia Foundation website is governed by an alternative privacy policy, it will link to such policy.', 'When a Wikimedia Foundation tool is governed by an alternative privacy policy, the page where the tool may be downloaded or enabled will include a link to that policy.', 'Community members++    The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers.', 'As a result, some volunteers have access to certain Personal Information, and use of that Personal Information may not be governed by this Privacy Policy.', 'These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites.', 'When these administrators access Personal Information that is nonpublic, they are required to comply with our Access to Nonpublic Information Policy, as well as other, tool-specific policies.', 'We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as wmflabs.org.', 'When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them.', 'When these volunteers access nonpublic information or Personal Information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.', 'We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other.', 'The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy.', 'Examples include: +    * posting to Foundation-hosted email lists;+    * requesting support from volunteers through our online ticketing system (email sent to info[at]wikimedia.org goes to this system);+    * emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and+    * chatting on IRC (such as on the #wikipedia channel).', 'Third parties++    This Privacy Policy only covers the way the Wikimedia Foundation collects, uses and discloses Personal Information and does not address the practices of third parties.', 'These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites.', 'These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content.', 'Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script,+gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our+knowledge.', 'This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information+they receive as a result of such a tool.', 'If you come across such a third-party+tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool+yourself, or report it to privacy[at]wikimedia.org so we can investigate.', 'Where community policies govern information, such as the CheckUser policy, the+relevant community may add to the rules and obligations set out in this+Policy.', 'However, they are not permitted to create new exceptions or otherwise+reduce the protections offered by this Policy.', 'When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or+discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece+of content added, removed, or altered by you.', 'The page history will show when+your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are+signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in).', 'We may use your+public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of+others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for+you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used.', 'Publicly Visible Information  +  +---  +  +Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you+actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including Personal Information, is+publicly visible and can be found by search engines.', 'Like most things on the+Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the+Internet by other people.', 'Please do not contribute any information that you+are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or+location in your contributions.', 'You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data+that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer+further information, such as which country a user is from, political+affiliation and gender.', 'If you do create an account, you do not need to give us your name or email+address.', 'If you do not create an account, your contributions will be publicly+attributed to your IP address.', 'You are not required to create an account to read or contribute to a Wikimedia+Site, except under rare circumstances.', 'However, if you contribute without+signing in, your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address+associated with your device.', 'If you want to create a standard account, in most cases we require only a+username and a password.', 'More on Usernames  +  +---  +  +Your username will be publicly visible, so please be careful about using your+real name as your username.', 'Your password is only used to verify that the+account is yours.', 'Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us, and+we record it temporarily to help prevent abuse.', 'No other personal information+is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, no credit card+information.', 'Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can+usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to).', 'This is+because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!).', 'In some circumstances, the Wikimedia communities can assist users with+removing additional information related to their account from the projects.', 'To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize+our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for+more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself.', 'We will+tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you+can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that+information.', "If you+don't want to, you don't have to—it's as simple as that.", 'If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to+determine location) to show you more relevant content.', 'We keep information+obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this+Policy.', 'You can learn more by checking out the list of examples of how we use+these technologies in our FAQ.', 'For+example, if you want to upload a photo on the Wikimedia Commons mobile app, we+may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo,+automatically from your device.', 'Please be aware that, unlike location+information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting+on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video+upload to the Wikimedia Sites.', 'If you do not want metadata sent to us and made+public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.', 'Like other websites, we receive some information about you automatically when+you visit the Wikimedia Sites.', 'We also use a variety of commonly-used technologies, like cookies, to collect+information regarding how you use the Wikimedia Sites, make our services safer+and easier to use, and to help create a better and more customizable+experience for you.', 'We want to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you by learning more about how+you use them.', 'Examples of this might include how often you visit the Wikimedia+Sites, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to the Wikimedia+Sites, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it+differently.', "We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our+community's values.", 'For this reason, we keep information related to your use+of the Wikimedia Sites confidential, except as provided in this Policy.', "This information includes the type of device+you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for+some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your+browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your+device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service+provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia+Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each+request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.", 'Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia+Sites.', 'For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide+greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize+content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and+improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites,+track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the+demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.', 'We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used+technologies.', 'These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a+variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local+storage.', 'We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best+reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes.', 'So we want to+be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of+information we collect with them.', 'Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data can be anything from+text, pictures, and whole articles (as we explain further below) to Personal+Information (like your IP address) and information about your use of the+Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit).', 'We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer+and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their+interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services.', 'We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so.', 'If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been+authorized by you (such as one that may have been mistakenly placed by another+user or administrator), please report it to us at privacy@wikimedia.org.', 'More on Locally Stored Data  +  +---  +  +Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:++  * Provide you with a customizable experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.', 'For example, we use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly.', 'Also, we use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.', '* Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful.', 'For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.', '* Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.', '* Make the Wikimedia Sites more convenient to use, such as by using cookies to maintain your session when you log in or to remember your username in the login field.', 'You can read more about some of the specific cookies+we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in our FAQ.', 'We believe this data collection helps improve your user experience, but you+may remove or disable some or all locally stored data through your browser+settings, depending on your browser.', 'You can learn more about some options you+have in our FAQ.', 'While locally stored data may not be necessary to use our+sites, some features will not function properly if you disable locally stored+data.', 'While the examples above concerning information about you collected through+the use of data collection tools are kept confidential in accordance with this+Policy, please note that some information about the actions taken by your+username is made publicly available through public logs

you.', '---  +  +  * To let you know about things that are happening with the Wikimedia Foundation, the Wikimedia Sites or the Wikimedia movement.', '* To alert you when there has been a change to an
