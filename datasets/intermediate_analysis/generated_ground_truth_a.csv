The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.
Some take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.
If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.

</i>Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.
What do I do?
<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.
We do not process any requests related to them.
But <strong>sticker sets</strong>, <strong>channels</strong>, and <strong>bots</strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available</em>.</p>
<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.
Please note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.</p>
<i>
</i>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?
<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.
To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public</strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.
For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.</p>
<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.
Whenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Please note that this does <strong>not</strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.
For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.
This goes against our founders' principles.
While we do block terrorist (e.g.
ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions",15, Telegram,1946,https://telegram.org/faq,approved
