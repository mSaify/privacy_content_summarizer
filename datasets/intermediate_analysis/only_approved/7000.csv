Uchovávání osobních údajů

Tento přístup je v souladu se zásadou omezení uložení, která zakotvuje povinnost vymazat nebo anonymizovat osobní údaje, pokud je už nepotřebujeme pro naplnění účelu jejich shromáždění.
Aktivní anonymizací naplňujeme zásadu účelového omezení (nezpracovávat osobní údaje za jinými účely, než za kterými byly shromážděny) a minimalizace jejich zpracování (zpracovávat pouze takové údaje, které jsou nezbytné pro dosažení stanoveného účelu).
